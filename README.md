# PixelDraw

I built a drawing app using React and TypeScript, incorporating Rough.js for a sketchy, hand-drawn style. This was a side project for learning purposes. The app is not responsive, as I primarily focused on functionality since I already have plenty of responsive projects.

## üì¶ Technologies

- `Vite`
- `React.js`
- `TypeScript`
- `Rough.js`
- `CSS`
- `Vitest`
- `Cypress` 
- `Testing Library`



## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ The Process

I started by rendering a canvas with rough.js to create the base for all the drawings. Then, I focused on drawing on the canvas, allowing users to make lines, rectangles, and other shapes.

Next, I made sure users could move elements around. This was important for adjusting drawings. After that, I added the ability to resize elements to give more control over the shapes.

To make sure mistakes could be fixed, I implemented undo and redo features. I also added freehand drawing for a more natural sketching experience and a text tool to label or note on the canvas.

To navigate larger drawings, I put in pan and zoom tools. With everything functioning, I designed the whole UI to make it user-friendly and appealing.

Finally, I added testing with Cypress and Testing Library. I conducted end-to-end tests on drawing and manipulating text, lines, rectangles, and freehand drawings to make sure everything worked smoothly.

Along the way, while building everything, I took notes on what I've learned so I don't miss out on it. I also documented the behind-the-scenes processes every time a feature was added.

This way, I understood what I've built. The funny thing is, as soon as I started to document what happened behind the scenes and the features I've added, it made me realize that we fully understand something once we've actually taken a step back, thought about it, and documented what we've done. I think this is a good practice to follow when learning something new.

##  What I Learned

During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of complex ideas, which improved my logical thinking.

1.React Hooks and Rendering:

 I learned about `useLayoutEffect`, which helps make sure changes are done before the screen updates. This was useful for certain drawing functions.

2. Advanced Event Handling:

I worked with the wheel event listener, which allowed me to add zooming and panning features. This made the app more interactive and user-friendly.


Each part of this project helped me understand more about building apps, managing complex information, and improving user experience. It was more than just making a tool. It was about solving problems, learning new things, and improving my skills for future work.
