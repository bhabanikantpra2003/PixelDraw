# PixelDraw

I built a drawing app using React and TypeScript, incorporating Rough.js for a sketchy, hand-drawn style. This was a side project for learning purposes. The app is not responsive, as I primarily focused on functionality since I already have plenty of responsive projects.

## üì¶ Technologies
- `React.js`
- `TypeScript`
- `Rough.js`
- `Cypress` 



## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ The Process

I started by rendering a canvas with Rough.js to create the base for all the drawings. Then, I focused on enabling users to draw lines, rectangles, and other shapes on the canvas.

Next, I made sure users could move elements around, which was crucial for adjusting drawings. After that, I added the ability to resize elements, giving users more control over their shapes.

To help fix mistakes, I implemented undo and redo features. I also introduced freehand drawing for a more natural sketching experience and a text tool for labeling or adding notes to the canvas.

For better navigation on larger drawings, I added pan and zoom tools. Once everything was functional, I designed the UI to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

Finally, I incorporated testing with Cypress and Testing Library. I conducted end-to-end tests on drawing, manipulating text, lines, rectangles, and freehand drawings to ensure smooth performance.

Throughout the process, I took notes on my learnings so I wouldn‚Äôt miss anything. I also documented the behind-the-scenes work every time I added a new feature.

Interestingly, as I started documenting the process and the features I built, I realized that true understanding comes when we step back, reflect, and articulate what we've done. This practice proved invaluable for learning something new.

##  What I Learned

During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of complex ideas, which improved my logical thinking.

Optimized Component Updates:
I explored useLayoutEffect, which ensures updates are processed before the browser repaints. This proved valuable for refining certain drawing behaviors.

Interactive Controls:
I implemented a wheel event listener to enable zooming and panning, making the app more dynamic and user-friendly.


Each part of this project helped me understand more about building apps, managing complex information, and improving user experience. It was more than just making a tool. It was about solving problems, learning new things, and improving my skills for future work.
